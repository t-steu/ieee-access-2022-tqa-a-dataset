# TQA-A dataset


This is the TQA-A dataset collected for answer extraction, as mentioned in the corresponding IEEE Access paper.

The `tqa-a` folder comprises the paragraph and sentence levels dataset (with the corresponding splits).

Two main points (see paper for more details):

- The dataset is probably too small for model training. It was primarily collected to show that systems trained on SQuAD or NQ do not transfer automatically to the educational domain.
- The experiments have been executed on the sentence level. However, paragraph-level experiments would also be valuable. For instance, sometimes preceding sentences hint toward the answer, or ground-truth answers are complete sentences.
